# footballmapies

Hey, so footballmapies is a little project I've developed for learning webscraping and use of gmplot module in python.

# Why Football map?

I'm a massive football fan and by my username you should've been able to guess that I am an Arsenal fan. I've also had a long standing interest and love towards geography.

# How does this code work?

I've written this code using the modules, gmplot(for map stuff), bs4(Beautiful Soup for scraping) and requests(Also for scraping). So basically I scrape the latitudes and the longitudes of the specific stadium in which the club plays, from this website called https://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/ (So shout out to them!).

Note that this code only works for the top 5 European leagues and if you don't find your desired league in here, just let me know and I'll try to add that country's most succesfull clubs as well.

-> In the last line of code please note that you'll have to create the path in which you want your output html file to be saved.
-> Make sure you've installed the modules gmaplot, requests-html,  and bs4
using these comands on the terminal:
pip install gmplot
pip install bs4
pip install requests-html
in windows OS.

This is a pretty rudimentary form of code, but it does work very well and I hope to make it more efficient in the successive commits to come!

# Finally

Thank you so much for looking into this small project of mine, it took me a lot of time to finish this project, so if you liked it, I'd appreciate a star and (or) or a fork

A Massive Thank You again, hope you put this into good use!
